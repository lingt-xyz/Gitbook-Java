# Variables

## Kinds of Variables

### \*\*\*\*1⃣ **Instance Variables \(Non-Static Fields\)** 

Technically speaking, objects store their individual states in "non-static fields", that is, fields declared without the `static` keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class \(to each object, in other words\); the `currentSpeed` of one bicycle is independent from the `currentSpeed` of another.

### 2⃣ Class Variables \(Static Fields\) 

A class variable is any field declared with the `static` modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. A field defining the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked as `static` since conceptually the same number of gears will apply to all instances. The code `static int numGears = 6;` would create such a static field. Additionally, the keyword `final` could be added to indicate that the number of gears will never change.

### \*\*\*\*3⃣ **Local Variables**

Similar to how an object stores its state in fields, a method will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field \(for example, `int count = 0;`\). There is no special keyword designating a variable as local; that determination comes entirely from the **location** in which the variable is declared — which is between the opening and closing braces of a method. As such, local variables are only visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class.

### \*\*\*\*4⃣ **Parameters**

Recall that the signature for the `main` method is `public static void main(String[] args)`. Here, the `args` variable is the parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is that parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well \(such as constructors and exception handlers\) .

## Naming Convention

Variable names are case-sensitive.

1. Begin with a letter.
2. Use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations.
3. If the name consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. If it stores a constant value, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character.
